It's really easy to get colors right. It's really hard to get black - and neutrals - right. Black is certainly a color but it's also an illusion. I would like to be a one-man multinational fashion phenomenon. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of. Don't dress to kill, dress to survive. I do not have one theme for each season, I just try to make beautiful clothes all year round.

Doing collections, doing fashion is like a non-stop dialogue. Design is a series of creative choices - it's a collaborative effort, an evolutionary process. You choose your fabrics depending upon what you want to say, then you work with mills to get those fabrics. Through the process, you realize what you want it to be. I want people to be afraid of the women I dress. I am not interested in shock tactics. I just want to make beautiful clothes. The key to my collections is sensuality.

A woman has the age she deserves. Sometimes incompetence is useful. It helps you keep an open mind. My job is to bring out in people what they wouldn't dare do themselves. My customers are successful workingwomen. Instead of buying six things, one thing that you really like. Don't keep buying just for the sake of it.
